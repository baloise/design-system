<Lead>The Baloise Design System provides multiple solutions for achieving a responsive design.</Lead>

- **[Using CSS](#)**:<br/>Utilize utility classes like `class="p-normal desktop:p-large"` for styling.
- **[Using Sass](#)**:<br/>Apply breakpoint mixins such as `@include desktop { ... }` for structured styling.
- **[Using Code](#)**:<br/>Leverage the breakpoint service to dynamically listen for viewport changes.

## Using CSS

Tailored responsive options are at your disposal for customizations according to screen size.
Simply append a responsive breakpoint keyword with a dash, like `tablet:m-large`, to apply the
corresponding responsive class.

  {`
| Class             | Description                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| \`mobile:\`       | small screens e.g. phones    |
| \`tablet:\`       | medium screens e.g. tablets  |
| \`desktop:\`      | large screens e.g. notebooks |
| \`widescreen:\`   | larger screens e.g monitors  |
`}
</Markdown>

<Code
  language="html"
  code={`
<p class="p-normal desktop:p-large bg-green-2">This text is normal on mobile and large on desktop.</p>
`}
/>

Check out the available CSS utility classes, as some are specifically designed to support responsiveness.

## Using Sass

To create a responsive layout you can either structure your app with the Sass mixins.

Use the scss mixins in your application the following:

<ScssSource code={`// SASS mixins and variables
@use '@baloise/ds-styles/sass/mixins' as *;

.my-component {
${' '}${' '}background: var(--bal-color-green);
}

@include desktop() {
${' '}${' '}// add your custom styles here
${' '}${' '}.my-component {
${' '}${' '}${' '}${' '}background: var(--bal-color-red);
${' '}${' '}}
}
`} />

The file `design-system-styles/sass/mixins` provides all design tokens as CSS-Variable and SASS mixins.

## Using Code

### Breakpoints

The Baloise Design System provides a service to dynamically listen for viewport changes.

```typescript
import { BalBreakpointService } from '@baloise/ds-angular'

export class MyComponent {
  readonly breakpoint = inject(BalBreakpointService)
}
```

```html
<p *ngIf="breakpoint.mobile()">This text is only visible on mobile.</p>
<p *ngIf="breakpoint.desktop()">This text is only visible on desktop.</p>
```

### Orientation

The Baloise Design System also provides a service to dynamically listen for orientation changes.

```typescript
import { BalOrientationService } from '@baloise/ds-angular'

export class MyComponent {
  readonly orientation = inject(BalOrientationService)
}
```

```html
<p *ngIf="orientation.landscape()">This text is only visible on landscape.</p>
<p *ngIf="orientation.portrait()">This text is only visible on portrait.</p>
```
