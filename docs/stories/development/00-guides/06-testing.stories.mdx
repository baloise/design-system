  The Baloise Design System offers a comprehensive list of utility functions designed specifically for testing web
  components.
</Lead>

Due to the asynchronous execution of these web components, it becomes essential to ensure proper
synchronization within tests. This involves implementing wait mechanisms to harmonize the testing process with the
asynchronous nature of the components' behavior.

## Unit Testing

To create effective unit tests, it is highly recommended to utilize the following tools:

- [Karma + Jasmin](https://angular.io/guide/testing) (only Angular)
- [Cypress Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview)

These tools offer robust capabilities for testing your components, ensuring their
functionality and behavior are thoroughly validated. By leveraging Karma with Jasmine
or utilizing Cypress Component Testing, you empower your testing efforts with
comprehensive frameworks that enhance the quality and reliability of your codebase.

<AngularFramework>

### Karma + Jasmin

This also serves as the default testing toolkit within the Angular framework.

```ts
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core'
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing'
import { BrowserModule, By } from '@angular/platform-browser'
import { BaloiseDesignSystemModule } from '@baloise/ds-angular'
import { waitForDesignSystem } from '@baloise/ds-core'
import { AppComponent } from './app.component'

describe('AppComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent],
      imports: [BrowserModule, BaloiseDesignSystemModule.forRoot()],
      schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
    }).compileComponents()
  })
  it('should render input value', async () => {
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent)
    fixture.detectChanges()

    // waits until the Design System has been initialized and the async
    // web components have been rendered
    await waitForDesignSystem()

    const input = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('[data-testid="input"]'))
    expect(input.nativeElement.value).toContain('My Value')
  })
})
```

Use the `waitForDesignSystem` utility function to ensure seamless synchronization,
waiting until the web component tree has been completely rendered.

For post-user interaction synchronization, use the utility function `waitForComponent`.
This function facilitates waiting until the component's state aligns with the desired condition.

<Code
  language="ts"
  code={`
button.click()
await fixture.whenStable()
await waitForComponent(fixture.nativeElement)

// do assertions here
expect(component.onEditButtonClick).toHaveBeenCalled()
`}
/>

</AngularFramework>

### Utilities

The Design System offers a set of utilities designed to facilitate the creation of robust unit tests.
Each of these functions returns a promise that can be conveniently resolved using the `await` keyword.

<Code
  language="ts"
  code={`
await waitForDesignSystem()
`}
/>

## Cypress E2E Testing

Discover an collection of custom Cypress commands tailored for the components.
Additionally, essential Cypress commands like <b>should</b> or <b>click</b> have been refined to seamlessly interact with the components.

- [Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview)
- [End-to-End Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)

### Prerequisites

To get started with Cypress, follow the steps outlined in the [Cypress Getting Started Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress).
This guide will provide you with detailed instructions on how to install and set up Cypress
for your testing needs. It covers topics such as installation, project setup, and running your first test. Happy testing!

### Configure

#### Cypress

To effectively interact with web components, it's essential to [configure Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Options) to accommodate shadow DOM.
This involves modifying the `cypress.config.ts` file and including the `includeShadowDom` option, setting it to `true`.

Follow these steps to configure Cypress for shadow DOM support:

1. Open the `cypress.config.ts` file in your project.

2. Add the following option to enable shadow DOM support:

<Code
  language="ts"
  code={`
{
  // Other configuration options...
  includeShadowDom: true,
  // More configuration options...
}
`}
/>

3. Save the file.

This configuration adjustment ensures that Cypress can properly interact with and test web components that utilize shadow DOM.

With this setting in place, you'll be able to seamlessly navigate and test web components that leverage shadow DOM for encapsulation and styling.

Remember that shadow DOM support enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of your tests when dealing with modern web components.

#### Testing Library

Begin by installing the testing library.

<Code
  language="bash"
  code={`
npm add -D @baloise/ds-testing
`}
/>

Navigate to the file `cypress/support/commands.ts` and import the testing library.
This action will grant you access to a suite of custom Cypress commands tailored to the framework.

```ts
/// <reference types="cypress" />

import '@baloise/ds-testing/add-custom-commands'
import '@baloise/ds-testing/add-override-commands'
```

- The file "add-custom-commands" introduces fresh commands to augment the existing list of Cypress commands.
- The "add-override-commands" file refines the functionality of existing commands, ensuring optimal support for web components within the design system.

### Component Testing

Open the "component-index.html" file and integrate the `bal-app` component.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Components App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <bal-app data-cy-root></bal-app>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Usage

A simple component has been developed, utilizing the CSS framework and its corresponding components.

```html
<div class="p-large">
  <h1 class="title">Native Title</h1>
  <bal-heading>Component Title</bal-heading>
</div>
```

Lets create the first test `hello.component.cy.ts`.

```html
<div class="p-large">
  <h1 class="title">Native Title</h1>
  <bal-heading>Component Title</bal-heading>
</div>
```

```typescript
import { BaloiseDesignSystemModule } from '@baloise/ds-angular'
import { HelloComponent } from 'src/app/hello/hello.component'

describe('hello.component.cy.ts', () => {
  it('playground', () => {
    // mount the angular component and import the needed
    // Design System modules
    cy.mount(HelloComponent, {
      imports: [BaloiseDesignSystemModule.forRoot()],
    })
    // lets wait until the Design System has loaded the custom font, Â¨
    // disabled the animations and the web-components have rendered
    cy.waitForDesignSystem()

    cy.get('bal-heading').contains('Component Title')
  })
})
```

### End-to-End Testing

### Usage

Comprehensive documentation for each component's commands is provided on the respective components page.

```typescript
import { byTestId, selectors } from '@baloise/ds-testing'

describe('Accordion', () => {
  const accordion = byTestId('my-accordion') // [data-testid="my-accordion"]

  it('should ...', () => {
    cy.get(accordion).find(selectors.accordion.trigger).contains('Show more')
    cy.get(accordion).balAccordionIsClosed()
    cy.get(accordion).click().balAccordionIsOpen()
    cy.get(accordion).find(selectors.accordion.trigger).contains('Show less')
    cy.get(accordion).find(selectors.accordion.content).contains('My Content')
    cy.get(accordion).click().balAccordionIsClosed()
  })
})
```

### Selectors

For optimal testing practices assigning specific test attributes, such as `data-testid`, to the elements you intend to test.

```html
<bal-button data-testid="my-button"></bal-button>
```

Construct the correct selector using the helper function byTestId, like [data-testid="my-button"].
This selector can then be used directly with the Cypress commands.

```typescript
import { byTestId } from '@baloise/ds-testing'

describe('Button', () => {
  it('should ...', () => {
    cy.getByTestId('button-id').click()
  })

  // or with the selector function

  it('should ...', () => {
    const button = byTestId('button-id')
    cy.get(button).click()
  })
})
```

### Component Selectors (WIP)

Each component internally defines specific `data-testid` selectors.

```typescript
import { selectors } from '@baloise/ds-testing'

describe('Accordion', () => {
  it('should ...', () => {
    cy.getByTestId('accordion').find(selectors.accordion.trigger).contains('Show more')
    cy.getByTestId('accordion').find(selectors.accordion.content).contains('My Content')
  })
})
```

### Component Commands

#### getByTestId

Retrieves the element or component using the `data-testid` attribute and internally triggers the `waitForComponents` command for complete loading.

```typescript
cy.getByTestId('button')
```

#### getByRole

The `getByRole` custom Cypress command simplifies the process of selecting elements by their ARIA role attribute.
This command is especially useful for targeting interactive components based on their role in the accessibility tree.

```typescript
cy.getByRole('button', { name: 'Button Label' }).click()
```

#### getByPlaceholder

The `getByPlaceholder` custom Cypress command provides a convenient way to select an element by its placeholder attribute. This is particularly
useful when you want to interact with input elements based on their placeholder text.

```typescript
cy.getByPlaceholder('Enter your username').type('myusername')
```

#### waitForDesignSystem

Delays execution until the custom font is loaded, the Design System is initialized, web-components
are prepared, and the initial browser print action is satisfied.
Furthermore, it deactivates all animations, promoting a more stable and efficient testing environment.

```typescript
cy.waitForDesignSystem()
```

#### waitForComponents

Awaits complete loading of the web component.

```typescript
cy.get('button').waitForComponents()
```

#### Viewport / Platform

The `platform` commands allows to switch between the breakpoints of the Design System

```typescript
cy.platform('mobile')
cy.platform('tablet')
cy.platform('desktop')
```
