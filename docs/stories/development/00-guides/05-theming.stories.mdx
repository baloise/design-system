  The Baloise Design System provides a versatile foundation that can be tailored and adjusted to match a brand's
  identity. Customizing the appearance of Baloise applications has never been simpler. As the framework is constructed
  using CSS, it arrives with pre-existing default styles that can be modified and adjusted with remarkable ease.

## CSS Variables

Baloise Design System components incorporate [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), enabling hassle-free customization of applications.
CSS Variables enable a value to be stored in a single location and referenced in numerous other locations.
They also facilitate dynamic CSS modification at runtime, a task that previously necessitated a CSS preprocessor.
Thanks to CSS variables, it is simpler than ever to replace Baloise Design System components to align with a brand or theme.

## Compact theme

The compact theme features a narrower layout with a reduced font size (14px instead of 16px). Additionally, spaces such as margins and paddings are adjusted to align with mobile dimensions, ensuring a more compact appearance.

To activate the compact theme, import the theme-compact stylesheet into the root App component or a global stylesheet.

It is recommended to import the theme-compact file at the end of your stylesheet, after the other imports from the Design System.

<Code
  language="js"
  code={`
@forward '@baloise/ds-styles/css/themes/compact';
`}
/>

## Custom theme

In an application, CSS variables can be established globally within the `:root` selector.

<Code
  language="css"
  code={`
:root {
  --bal-color-primary: pink;
  --bal-font-family-title: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
`}
/>

### By Component

To assign a CSS variable for a specific component, incorporate the variable within its selector.

Change the default background to aqua

<Code
  language="css"
  code={`
bal-badge {
  --bal-badge-background: aqua;
}
`}
/>

Change the background on an badge with the .my-badge class

<Code
  language="css"
  code={`
.my-badge {
  --bal-badge-background: lime;
}
`}
/>

### By JavaScriptâ€‹

Using [setProperty()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/setProperty) in JavaScript, CSS variables can also be altered:

<Code
  language="js"
  code={`
const el = document.querySelector('.my-badge')
el.style.setProperty('--bal-badge-background', 'lime')
`}
/>

import theming from './theming/theming.md?raw'
