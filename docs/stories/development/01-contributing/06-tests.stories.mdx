## Create new visual test

When initiating the creation of a visual test, the initial step is to navigate to
the `/design-system/test/cypress/e2e/visual` directory. Once there, proceed to create a
new file with the appropriate name for the test.

Here's a basic example of how the test might look like:

```ts
describe('bal-content', () => {
  beforeEach(() =>
    cy.visit('/components/bal-content/test/bal-content.visual.html').platform('desktop').waitForDesignSystem(),
  )
  it('basic component', () => {
    cy.getByTestId('basic').testVisual('content-basic')
    cy.getByTestId('alignment').testVisual('content-alignment')
    cy.getByTestId('direction').testVisual('content-direction')
    cy.getByTestId('space').testVisual('content-space')
  })
})
```

`testVisual` command captures a screenshot or visual representation of the specified UI element as it
appears in the browser during test execution. This captured visual data is then compared against a baseline
or reference image to detect any visual regressions or unexpected changes in the UI layout, styling, or appearance.

## How to start E2E tests locally

To start tests locally run this command:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

import RunE2E from '../../assets/images/contribution/run-e2e.gif'

<img src={RunE2E} />

## Types of test we do

<Markdown>
  {`
| File                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| bal-badge.tsx           | Stencil component which will be compiled into Web-Component. |
| bal-badge.sass          | Custom component stylesheet, which is lazy loaded.           |
| bal-badge.interfaces.ts | Types for properties and events of the component.            |
| bal-badge.vars.sass     | CSS variables which can be used for theming.                 |
  `}
</Markdown>

More about testing can be found [here](/?path=/docs/development-testing--documentation).

## Investigate visual diff

When a visual test fails, it typically indicates that there is a difference between the current
visual representation of the UI component being tested and the expected or baseline visual state.

To check why the test failed:

import VisualReport from '../../assets/images/contribution/visual-report.gif'

<img src={VisualReport} />

Open the folder you downloaded and locate the "report" HTML file. Then, double-click or open
the report HTML file to view the detailed information about the failed test.

import VisualReportImage from '../../assets/images/contribution/visual-report.png'

<img src={VisualReportImage} />

## Update base images

If you wish to update the base images, you’ll need to perform the appropriate action.

Running the **/create-base-image** followed by the file name of the visual test will generate
base images only for specific component.

There is an option to generate base images for all the components, in that case run
only **/create-base-image** command.

import CreateBaseImage from '../../assets/images/contribution/action-create-base-images.gif'

<img src={CreateBaseImage} />

## Unit tests

We're using unit tests to make sure each specific part of our software works as it should.
Run them with this command

```bash
npm run test
```

To test different packages use this command and change the package name (styles)

```bash
npx nx run core:test
```

Or open the Vitest Dashboard

```bash
npx nx run core:test-ui
```

import UnitTests from '../../assets/images/contribution/unit-tests.png'

<img src={UnitTests} />

### Location example

In this case we have file-validation util for file-upload component and unit test for it is located in the
"test" folder with name "file-validation.util.spec.ts".

<img src={UnitTestsStructure} />

import UnitTestsStructure from '../../assets/images/contribution/unit-test-structure.png'
