All our extended or own cypress commands are located in the `packages/testing/src/commands` directory.

The documentation explaining how to test can be found [here](?path=/docs/development-getting-started-testing--page).
</Lead>


## Getting Started

The testing part runs against our component demo pages. Therefore, we need to start the server with `npm run lib:server` from the root directory.

Then navigate with a second terminal into the component package:

```bash
cd packages/testing
```

Inside the folder `src/commands` are the cypress commands. Each component and command gets tested with E-2-E Cypress tests located in the folder `cypress/integration`

To open the cypress testing tools run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Structure

### Custom Command

The structure of the custom command is important, because the documentation is automatically generate out of it, as well as the type definitions.

Custom commands are created for our components, therefore the files are suffixed with the name of the component. Each custom command has two files:

- `bal-accordion.command` the execution code of the new command
- `bal-accordion.type` the type definitions for the autocompletion for users

#### Command

```typescript
Cypress.Commands.add(
  'balAccordionIsOpen',
  {
    prevSubject: true,
  },
  subject => {
    return cy.wrap(subject).should('have.attr', 'is-active', '')
  },
)
```

#### Type

```typescript
/// <reference types="cypress" />

declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable {
    /**
     * Asserts if the accordion is open.
     */
    balAccordionIsOpen(): Chainable<JQuery>
  }
}
```

## Overrides

Some of the cypress commands like `.type()` needed to be changed to match our components.

In most cases we need to find the correct native element or change the selectors.

For each command we override, we create a new file like `type.command.ts`. Inside of this file we override the command, but the default return is the command itself. We only catch our special cases (components).

```typescript
import { isInput, selectors, wrapRoot } from '../helpers'

Cypress.Commands.overwrite('type', (originalFn, element: Cypress.Chainable<JQuery>, content, options) => {
  if (isInput(element)) {
    return wrapRoot(element, selectors.input.native, $el => originalFn($el, content, options))
  }

  return originalFn(element, content, options)
})
```

> **TIP**
> In the file `src/commands/helpers.ts` the selectors and the component util functions are defined.
