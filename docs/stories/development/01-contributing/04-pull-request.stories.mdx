Pull request are create out of an GitHub issue. Therefore lets create one first:

## 1. Report an issue

Pull request are create out of an GitHub issue. Therefore lets create one first:

<a
  className="button is-primary mt-normal sb-unstyled"
  href="/?path=/docs/development-contributing-how-to-fix-a-bug--documentation#1-report-an-issue"
>
  Report a Bug
</a>

<a
  className="button is-primary mt-normal sb-unstyled"
  href="/?path=/docs/development-contributing-how-to-create-a-feature--documentation#1-report-an-issue"
>
  Report a Feature
</a>

## 2. Create issue branch

Once you've created an issue, the next step is to initiate the development of your feature by creating a branch.
You can do this directly within the issue you've just opened by adding a comment that includes this command:

```bash
/cib
```

This command triggers the creation of a new branch linked to your issue, and a corresponding pull request will be automatically generated.

import CreateIssueBranch from '../../assets/images/contribution/create-issue-branch.gif'

<img src={CreateIssueBranch} />

## 3. Finalize your Pull Request

Prepare your pull request:

1. Commit, and push the code changes
2. Add changeset for changelog documentation
3. Check that the Continuous is green
4. Pull request is approved by one of the core-members or code owners

After the above checks the pull request can be merged into the main branch.
