## Overview

Here is an overview of the breaking changes of the newly introduced version 17:

- [Deprecated Component Removal](#deprecated-component-removal)**:** <br/>Removed `bal-datepicker` for performance reasons

## Deprecated Component Removal

### Why the Change?

The datepicker is being refactored to improve performance, enhance user experience, leverage a better third-party library,
and reduce the overall payload size.

### What's Changing?

Replaced `bal-datepicker` with the new `bal-date` component.

### How to Upgrade

Replace the current import statement for the old datepicker component with the new one.
The interface for the new datepicker is almost identical to the old one, so minimal changes should be needed.
