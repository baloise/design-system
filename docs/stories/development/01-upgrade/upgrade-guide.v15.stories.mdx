Updating from v14 to v15

The primary objective of these breaking changes is to support compatibility with **Angular v17** alongside **Vite.js**
and **standalone components**.

<InfoQuote>

The following workflow walks you through the upgrade steps.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance
rather than strict instructions.

## Angular Builder

Check your Angular builder at `projects.angular.architect.build.builder` in the `angular.json` file. This defines
which Baloise Design System Components library the project requires. See table below.

<Markdown>
  {`
| Builder                                         | Package                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\`         | \`@baloise/design-system-components-angular/legacy\`           |
| \`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild\` | \`@baloise/design-system-components-angular\` or \`/standalone\` |
| \`@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\`     | \`@baloise/design-system-components-angular\` or \`/standalone\` |
`}
</Markdown>

Update the imports in the project accordingly.

</AngularFramework>

## Component Sass

Removed the deprecated option of component styles with SASS. Instead, for customizing the component design, use CSS Variables.

<DiffSource
  code={`
- <bal-app mode="sass"> ...content </bal-app>
+ <bal-app> ...content </bal-app>`}
/>

All styles are loaded lazy now and can be changed with CSS-Variables.

## Form State

Now by default the Baloise Design System will mark a form control as invalid when it's been touched and is indeed invalid.
To disable this feature, set `setInvalid` to `false` in the design system configuration.

<DiffSource
  code={`BaloiseDesignSystemModule.forRoot({
-  forms: {
-    setInvalid: true,
-  },
})`}
/>

## Polyfills

The option to `applyPolyfills` for outdated browsers such as IE11 and legacy Edge has been deprecated,
as the current design system no longer provides support for these versions.

<DiffSource
  code={`BaloiseDesignSystemModule.forRoot({
- applyPolyfills: true,
})`}
/>
