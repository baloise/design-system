## Overview

Here is an overview of the breaking changes of the newly introduced version 18:

- **Checkbox & Radio Adjustments due to A11y:**
  - Remove component bal-checkbox-button, bal-radio-button
  - Change naming of interface variables

## Checkbox & Radio Adjustments

Refactored the checkbox and radio components to improve accessibility (A11y) and align with the upcoming EU Accessibility Act.

### Why the Change?

The breaking changes to the checkbox and radio components were introduced to improve accessibility (A11y), ensuring better HTML structure
and enhanced screen reader support. These updates align with the upcoming EU Accessibility Act, which mandates higher accessibility
standards for digital products. By making these adjustments, we aim to provide a more inclusive experience for all users
while adhering to legal requirements and modern accessibility best practices.

### How to Upgrade

The `<bal-checkbox-button>` and `<bal-radio-button>` component has been removed and
replaced with the `<bal-checkbox>` or `<bal-radio>` component. Radio can be migrated like the checkbox.

<DiffSource
  code={`- <bal-checkbox-group>
+ <bal-checkbox-group interface="tile">
-   <bal-checkbox-button>
+   <bal-checkbox name="checkbox-example" value="1">
      <bal-stack>
        <bal-content>
          <bal-label>Only with label</bal-label>
        </bal-content>
-        <bal-checkbox label-hidden="true" name="checkbox-example" value="1"></bal-checkbox>
+        <bal-check></bal-check> <!-- OR <bal-switch></bal-switch> -->
        <bal-label>Only with label</bal-label>
      </bal-stack>
-   </bal-checkbox-button>
+   </bal-checkbox>
  </bal-checkbox-group>`}
/>

The interface has been changed from `select-button` to `button`.

<DiffSource
  code={`- <bal-checkbox-group interface="select-button">
+ <bal-checkbox-group interface="button">
    <bal-checkbox checked="true">
        Label
    </bal-checkbox>
    <bal-checkbox>
        Label
    </bal-checkbox>
  </bal-checkbox-group>`}
/>

Or directly use the `<bal-checkbox>` component.

<DiffSource
  code={`- <bal-checkbox interface="select-button">
+ <bal-checkbox interface="button">
    Label
  </bal-checkbox>`}
/>
