<Lead>
  A design system is a collection of reusable functional elements–components and patterns, guided by clear standards
  that product teams use to create a consistent experience across a range of products. Design Systems act as a single
  source of truth for an entire organization by using a singular design language to guide the development of products.

#### Why should everybody use Design Systems?

A Design System is not just a collection of design artifacts – there is a whole philosophy behind. To create a great user experience, product teams should understand not only what they need to build but also why they need to build it. That’s why design vision (in the form of a company or product strategy) and design principles (fundamental ideas about the practice of user interface design) should always be used as a foundation for design systems. Your design vision acts as a North Star for designers, communicating to product teams the purpose of their designs. Design principles guide product teams by helping them reach the ultimate purpose or goal of the product.

Well structured Design Systems provide enough freedom for product teams to experiment and try different creative approaches to solving problems. Product teams should never face major roadblocks from a Design System when implementing new visuals – it should always be easy to update a design in modern and fresh ways.

Design Systems should also be flexible and responsive to any changes in the field of design, such as new visual design trends or the rising importance of different types of emerging technology.

### Advantages

In this section key advantage of the library are listed which are part of the Baloise Design System.

#### 📦 Agnostic

Perhaps one of the most appealing benefits of using Web Components is the flexibility to choose the underlying tools and frameworks (including their versions). To facilitate the effort of teams to use one unified standard based on Web Components, every team has complete freedom in choosing the tools they love today and will love tomorrow.

[Quote from Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/faq)

#### Framework Support

The Baloise Design System is compatible with any Web-Technology. It includes a dedicated library for Angular and React, along with proxy components.

#### 🎨 Fast style changes

Today, every change to the corporate Style-Guide has to be implemented by each development team.
This costs a lot of effort and generates unnecessary costs. Let's imagine that a color has to be changed and
buttons have to be made flat. With the Baloise Design System only the according [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
have to be changed.

```css
:root {
  --bal-color-primary: red;
  --bal-radius-normal: 0;
}
```

The changes will be released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baloise/ds-core) from where development teams can grab new changes.
Only the library has to be upgraded by every project and style changes are immediately applied.
Style changes will not change the component interface, meaning that the developers don't have to do any additional adjustment.

#### ⚡️ Fast Runtime

[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Web_Components) offered a solution by pushing more work to the browser for better performance. Moreover, the components get lazy loaded when they need. To keep the initial package size of your project as small as possible.

##### Browser Support

The Library supports the following browsers. For more details go to [Stencil - Browser Support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support).

#### 🛠️ Rich Features

On top of the user interaction and style part, the library also provides a set of utilities.

##### Testing

The recommended [E-2-E testing](../?path=/docs/development-testing--documentation) tool is [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
Custom and overridden commands are employed to streamline the process of writing tests.
The commands hide the complexity of the component and only serve as an interface for simulated user actions like a click.

```typescript
describe('Button', () => {
  it('should ...', () => {
    cy.getByTestId('button-id').contains('Label').click()
  })
})
```

## Architecture

The Baloise Design System is an open source project to build customer centric web applications following the Baloise corporate styling guidelines.

The architecture is rooted in web standards and industry best practices. Additionally, simplicity is prioritized for contributors and consumers.
For these reasons, Web Components were chosen, as they enjoy widespread support across modern browsers. The project provides full support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Packages

The project is divided into various packages. The graphic below draws a more detailed picture.

<img src={ArchitectureImage} />

<PackageTable />

### Libraries

<ul className="sb-unstyled list">
  <li>
    [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create
    new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build
    on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or
    framework that works with HTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) is a Web Component compiler for building fast, reusable UI components and
    Progressive Web Apps.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It
    streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.
  </li>
</ul>

#### Stencil.js

Stencil is a toolchain for building reusable, scalable Design Systems. Generate small, blazing fast, and 100% standards based Web Components that run in every browser.

##### Future Friendly

We don't know what will be the next big framework, but by using Stencil that does not matter. Stencil is not dependent on any framework. As mentioned above it is a compiler to generate standard-based [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), which can be used with any framework.

##### TypeScript Support

TypeScript helps maintaining the code. Additionally, Stencil generates types for the components, which helps during development.

##### Browser Support

For the small minority of browsers that do not support modern browsers, features and APIs, Stencil will automatically polyfill them on-demand.
Out-of-the-box browser support includes all modern browsers starting from Internet Explorer 11 ([Browser Support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support)).

##### Easy to learn

The tiny API and concepts, which are based on web standards, are quite similar to the concepts and APIs of the most known JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular. So it is really simple to get started. The goal is not to create yet-another-framework, but rather provide tooling for developers to generate future-friendly components using APIs already baked within the browser.

##### Needs no dependencies at runtime

The generated code does not rely on Stencil, but rather generates highly-optimized, framework-free, stand-alone code which runs natively in browsers.

#### Storybook

**Build component driven UIs faster**
Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.

##### Playground

The developers can create components in an isolated environment and have an interactive showcase/playground.
Change controls/props, have a look at fired events and a lot more is possible with playground.

##### Accessibility

Storybook evaluates the components against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).

##### Documentation

A perfect mix of documentation with markdown and creating stories/variants of components for the playground.

##### Addons

Storybook has a rich list of available addons which can be integrated very easy, like accessibility checks.

##### SWOT analysis of Storybook

Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for UI components.
