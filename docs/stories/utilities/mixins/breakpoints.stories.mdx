<Lead>To create a responsive layout you can either structure your app with the Sass mixins.</Lead>

Use the scss mixins in your application the following:

<ScssSource code={`@import '@baloise/design-system-css/sass/mixins';

@include desktop() {
// add your custom styles here
// from the desktop breakpoint on
}
`} />

The file `design-system-css/sass/mixins` provides all design tokens as CSS-Variable and SASS mixins.

### Basic SASS Mixins

<Markdown>
  {`
| Mixin                                       | Description                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| \`from($breakpoint)\`                         | Styles are applied from this breakpoint on. |
| \`until($breakpoint)\`                        | Styles are applied until this breakpoint.   |
| \`between($min-breakpoint, $max-breakpoint)\` | Only between the breakpoints.               |
`}
</Markdown>

<ScssSource code={`.bal-element {
  color: lime;
}

@include from(var(--bal-breakpoint-tablet)) {
${' '}${' '}// add your custom styles here
${' '}${' '}.bal-element {
${' '}${' '}${' '}${' '}color: blue;
${' '}${' '}}
}
`}
/>

### Named SASS Mixins

The named mixins have the breakpoint already declared on work with the standard.

<Breakpoints />

#### Usage

Always define mobile first and afterwards the style changes for the different breakpoints.

<ScssSource code={`
.bal-element {
  color: lime;
}

@include tablet() {
${' '}${' '}.bal-element {
${' '}${' '}${' '}${' '}color: red;
${' '}${' '}}
}

@include desktop() {
${' '}${' '}.bal-element {
${' '}${' '}${' '}${' '}color: blue;
${' '}${' '}}
}
`}
/>
