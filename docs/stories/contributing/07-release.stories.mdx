## Document Changes

In our release process, we utilize **changesets** to manage and track the modifications introduced through pull requests (PRs).
A changeset represents a set of changes that are grouped together and associated with a particular release version.

**Adding a changeset** for your branch typically involves summarizing the changes youâ€™ve made since the last commit or changeset.
This summary helps other collaborators understand what has been modified, added, or removed in the codebase.

Run the command:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

When you execute the command, you'll be prompted with a series of questions.

1. You'll be asked about the type of change you've made.
2. You'll have the option to select the scope of this change; if you've only modified a specific component, you can specify it here. 3. You'll be prompted to provide a summary of the changes you've made.

The command creates a changeset file(.md) in the folder .changeset. Please commit that in your open pull request.

Here's a general guide on how to add a changeset for your branch:

import Changeset from '../assets/images/contribution/changeset.gif'

## Create a Snapshot Version (snapshot)

Snapshot releases represent versions of our branches, offering users early access for testing and evaluation.

```bash
/snapshot
```

**Version Syntax**

```
1.0.0-snapshot.31-c125396
<version>-snapshot.<pull request number>-<commit-sha>
```

import Snapshot from '../assets/images/contribution/snapshot.gif'

<img src={Snapshot} />

## Create new Release (latest)

When a pull request is merged into the main branch, our system automatically generates a corresponding
**Release pull request**.

The **Release PR** undergoes review by the core team members to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the changes.

Once approved, merging the URL **Release PR** triggers the release and publish process for the associated version.

import Release from '../assets/images/contribution/release.gif'

<img src={Release} />

## Nightly Releases (nightly)

Every night the Design System runs a continuous run on the main branch to ensure the stability and quality of the project.
In the continuous run the project gets linted, builded and tested. After that the Designs System gets releases to npm with the nightly tag.

**Version Syntax**

```
1.0.0-nightly.20240312
<version>-nightly.<timestamp YYYYMMDD>
```
