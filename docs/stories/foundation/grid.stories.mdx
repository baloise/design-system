## Breakpoints

Every webpage is accessed by different screen sizes and resolutions. To create a responsive webpage we use the defined
breakpoints.

We have 6 breakpoints:

<Markdown>
  {`
| Breakpoint          | min-width |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| **Mobile**          | 0px       |
| **Tablet**          | 769px     |
| **Desktop**         | 1024px    |
| **High-Definition** | 1280px    |
| **Widescreen**      | 1440px    |
| **FullHD**          | 1920px    |
`}
</Markdown>

### Breakpoint Ranges

<Markdown>
  {`
| Breakpoint  | min-width          | Description                      |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Touch**   | 0px to 1023px      | Combines mobile and tablet       |
| **Desktop** | 1024px to infinity | Combines all desktop breakpoints |
`}
</Markdown>

## Containers

A container defines the max-width of a website content.

import LayoutOverview from '../assets/images/foundations/layout/layout.svg'

<ImageCanvas size="large">
  <img src={LayoutOverview} />
</ImageCanvas>

<Markdown>
  {`
| Container   | Usage                                                       | max-width |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **default** | Default container for the most use cases.                   | 1496px    |
| **compact** | Should be used for sales funnels and small forms.           | 896px     |
| **fluid**   | For large application to use the whole width of the screen. | 100%      |
`}
</Markdown>

## Grid

Our designs align to a 8pt based grid, which is our base unit for all viewports (mobile, tablet and desktop).
Exceptions using a 4pt based grid can be smaller components, such as icons.
We decided for 8pt, as the most popular screen sizes are divisible by 8 on at least one axis -
usually both ([8-pt-grid](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid)). Base units help us to keep our designs consistent,
make the collaboration of designers and developers more efficient, and work best for the most popular
resolutions.

### Columns

The grid has maximum number of 12 columns.

import Grid from '../assets/images/foundations/grid/grid.svg'

  <img src={Grid} />
