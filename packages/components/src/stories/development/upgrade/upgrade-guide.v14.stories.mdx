## New Design Tokens for Z-Index values

In version 14, we've introduced `z-index` values as design tokens. Consequently, adjustments were made to each component.
If you've been using **custom z-index values** in your app, please be aware that this could potentially result in broken layouts.

After upgrading the design system in your app, please take a moment to check if any layouts are affected. If necessary, make adjustments to the z-index accordingly.
