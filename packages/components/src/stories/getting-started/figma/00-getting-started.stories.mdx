## Color

Baloise uses colors purposefully to communicate how things function in the interface. This helps us create visual patterns that can make interacting with our products easier and more predictable for customers.
The color system uses a semantic naming structure, which means the names tell us about the purpose or use case of the colors rather than their hue. To see how colors are named and organized in the UI kit,

### Using color styles

Color styles can be enabled by adding the ‘Baloise DS for Web: Colors’ library to your Figma files.

## Typography

Using consistent and logical hierarchies ensures that elements in the UI are clear and easily recognizable when scanning the page. Text sizes, styles, and layouts were selected to balance content and UI and to foster familiarity.

### Using text styles

Color styles can be enabled by adding the ‘Baloise DS for Web: Typography’ library to your Figma files.

## Layout Grids and Spacing

Consistent spacing creates visual balance that makes the user interface (UI) easier for users to scan. Apply consistent spacing to improve the quality of the UI.

### Using Layout

Grid styles can be enabled by adding the ‘Baloise DS for Web: Spacing’ library to your Figma files.

### Using Brand Assets

Brand Assets can be enabled by adding the ‘Baloise DS for Web: Brand Assets’ library to your Figma files.

<bal-doc-image text="brand-assets" src="/assets/images/figma/brand-assets.png" />
