# Architecture

The Baloise Design System is an open source project for styling awesome web applications that follow the Baloise corporate styling guidelines.

The architecture is based on web standards and best practices. Moreover, we try to keep it as simple as possible for our contributors and consumers.
For those reasons we decided to use Web Components, which are supported by all modern browsers. The project fully supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Architecture Library

The project is devided into various packges. The graphic below should ilustrate that a bit more in detail.

| [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) | Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. |
| [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)                                   | The Bulma framework is a free CSS solution based on the Flexbox layout. With Bulma, the extensive range of built-in features means faster turnaround and less CSS code writing.                                                                                                                                                            |

## Architecture Documentation

To document the components and design parts we use the great tool [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Stencil.js

![Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/assets/img/stenciljs-og.png?1)

> Stencil is a toolchain for building reusable, scalable Design Systems. Generate small, blazing fast, and 100% standards based Web Components that run in every browser.

### Here are some advantages

#### Future Friendly

We don't know which is going to be the next big framework on the horizon, but with Stencil we do not have to care. Stencil does not depend on any framework. As mentioned above it is a compiler to generate standards-based [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), which can be used with any framework.

#### TypeScript Support

TypeScript helps maintaining the code. Additionally, Stencil generates types for the components, which helps during developement.

#### Browser Support

For the small minority of browsers that do not support modern browser features and APIs, Stencil will automatically polyfill them on-demand.
Out-of-the-box browser support includes all modern browsers starting from Internet Explorer 11 ([Browser Support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support)).

#### Easy to learn

The tiny API and concepts, which are based on web standards, are quite simular to the concepts and APIs of the major JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue and Angular. So it is really simple to get started. The goal is not to create yet-another-framework, but rather provide tooling for developers to generate future-friendly components using APIs already baked within the browser.

#### Needs no dependencies at runtime

The generated code does not rely on Stencil, but rather it generates highly-optimized, framework-free, stand-alone code which runs natively in the browser.

## Bulma

![Bulma](https://bulma.io/images/bulma-logo.png)

> Bulma is fully open-source lightweight CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) solution based on the Flexbox layout.

### Here are some advantages

#### Easy to learn

Bulmas components are well-documented and have simplified css classes. Every class name is human readable. Moreover, they provide some really good starter templates.

#### CSS only

At the end Bulma is just one CSS file (bulma.css). However, if you just want to use a part of it import the individual .sass source files.

#### Responsive

Bulma is designed as a mobile-first CSS framework, offering optimum site responsiveness. Build a site once and watch it work across any device.

#### Well documented

The [Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) helps you getting the most out of this framework. There are a lot examples for each component.

#### Modular

Bulma is not an all in one framework. It is modular, which means you can only import those components that you need. For that just import the individual sass file.

#### Customizable

Of cource, not everyone likes the theme of bulma. No problem, just import the variables.scss file and change the colors. Each component has its own sass variables, which can be easily changed to design a new theme.

### SWOT analyse of Bulma

This is not another framework. It is a compiler that generates standards-based [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) (more specifically, Custom Elements). They can be used without any framework, because they are just [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

With Stencil we are able to develop universal, framework and library agnostic UI elements that can be shared among different projects.

## Storybook

![Storybook](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/54173593/39e57000-a3fa-11e9-83c7-953827061607)

> **Build component driven UIs faster**
> Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.

### Here are some advantages

#### Playground

The developers can create components in a isolated development and have an interactive showcase/playground.
Change controls/props, have a look at the fired events and more is available in the playground.

#### Accessibility

Storybook evaluates the components against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).

#### Documentation

A perfect mix of documentation with markdown and creating stories/variants of components for the playground.

#### Addons

Storybook has a rich list of available addons and can be integrated like accessibility really easy.

### SWOT analyse of Storybook

Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for UI components.
