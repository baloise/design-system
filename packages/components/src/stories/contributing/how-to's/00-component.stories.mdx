# Write your own Component

All our components are located in the `packages/components/src/components` dir.

Before writing or updating a component please finish the [dev setup](/components/contributing/installation.html)

To create a new one just run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Change the extension of the generated `bal-component.css` file to `bal-component.scss` and update it in the `bal-component.tsx` file aswell.

> Every component in this project should start with the prefix `bal-`.
