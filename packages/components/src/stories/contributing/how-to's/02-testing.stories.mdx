# Write your own Testing Command

All our extended or own cypress commands are located in the `packages/testing/src/commands` dir.

Before writing or updating a component please finish the [dev setup](/components/contributing/installation.html)

The documentation to the testing can be found [here](components/tooling/testing.html).

## Getting Started

The testing part runs against our component demo pages. Therefore, we need to start the server with `npm run lib:server` from the root directory.

Then navigate with a second terminal into the component package:

```bash
cd packages/testing
```

Inside the folder `src/commands` are the cypress commands. Each component and command gets testet with E-2-E Cypress tests located in the folder `cypress/integration`

To open the cypress testing tools run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Structure

### Custom Command

The structure of the custom command is importend, because out of it the documentation is automatically generate as well as the type definitions.

Custom commands are create for our components, therefore the files are suffiex with the name of the component. Each custom command has two files:

- `bal-accordion.command` the execution code of the new command
- `bal-accordion.type` has the type definitions for the autocompletion for the users.

#### Command

```typescript
Cypress.Commands.add(
  'balAccordionIsOpen',
  {
    prevSubject: true,
  },
  subject => {
    return cy.wrap(subject).should('have.attr', 'is-active', '')
  },
)
```

#### Type

```typescript
/// <reference types="cypress" />

declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable {
    /**
     * Asserts if the accordion is open.
     */
    balAccordionIsOpen(): Chainable<JQuery>
  }
}
```

## Overrides

Some of the cypress commands like `.type()` needed to be changed to match our components.

In the most cases we need to find the correct native element or change the selectors.

For each command we override we create a new file like `type.command.ts`. Inside we override the command, but the default return is the command it self. We only catch our special cases (components).

```typescript
import { isInput, selectors, wrapRoot } from '../helpers'

Cypress.Commands.overwrite('type', (originalFn, element: Cypress.Chainable<JQuery>, content, options) => {
  if (isInput(element)) {
    return wrapRoot(element, selectors.input.main, $el => originalFn($el, content, options))
  }

  return originalFn(element, content, options)
})
```

> **TIP**
> In the file `src/commands/helpers.ts` the selectors and the component util functions are defined.
