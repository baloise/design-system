<bal-doc-lead>This is the recommended layout layout for our Web Applications.</bal-doc-lead>

## Layouts

To layout your solution use our foundations below.

- [Containers](?path=/docs/foundation-grid-development--grid#containers)
- [Grid](?path=/docs/foundation-grid-development--grid#grid)
- [Flexbox](?path=/docs/foundation-layout-development--basic-layout&globals=framework:vue#flexbox)

### Basic Layout

The layout is constructed with a container to give the content a max-width and a standard space to the right and left side of the screen. Navbar should be used for web applications and the Navigation for Webpages. The footer component automatically grabs the necessary links from our CMS so that they are always up to date.

- The `.container` is a simple utility class that allows you to center content on larger viewports and to reduce the main space.
  - Use `container is-compact` for sales funnels to reduce the max-width to a minimum.
  - [Documentation to the container](?path=/docs/foundation-grid-overview--page#containers)
- `.has-sticky-footer` css-class sticks the footer element to the bottom of the page.

## Flexbox

Helpers for all Flexbox properties

Combined with `is-flex`, all of the Flexbox CSS properties are available as CSS helpers:

- flex-direction
- flex-wrap
- justify-content
- align-content
- align-items
- align-self
- flex-grow
- flex-shrink

> These helpers are based on the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/documentation/helpers/flexbox-helpers/).

This section has some examples how to use the provided flexbox css class helpers.

### Centered

To center a child in a parent element use the following classes:

- `is-flex` to enable display flex
- `is-justify-content-center` to set the child horizontally to center
- `is-align-items-center` to set the child vertically to center
