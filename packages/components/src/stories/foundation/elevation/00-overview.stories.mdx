## Shadow

Shadows make the visual level clear where components and elements are located.
They help users quickly understand the UI. As such,
it’s important to use the right shadow for a specific use case.

### Box Shadow

Use the Normal shadow for all use cases (e.g. cards, snackbar, toast etc.).
The Large shadow is only used for hover effects.

### Text Shadow

Use text shadow when readability is not given due to a image background. Like with the
stage component.
