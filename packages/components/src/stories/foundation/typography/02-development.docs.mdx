## Installation

By default our custom fonts are provided from our static web server. However, if
the fonts need to provided locally then please check out the next section.

CSS-Utilities are provide by the CSS-Framework, which is already included in the components packages.

### Font

Next step is to provide the custom fonts from you web application server.

#### Provide fonts files

To do so we recommend the tool **copyfiles** to copy the font files into your assets folder.

> **Important!**
>
> The font package is already included in the **component** packages.

After installing our copyfiles dependency we need to define the copy commands in our **package.json** file.

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "npm run copy:assets",
  "copy:assets": "npm run copy:fonts",
  "copy:fonts": "copyfiles --flat node_modules/@baloise/design-system-fonts/lib/* src/assets/fonts",
}
```

> **TIP**
>
> If favicons are provided to just extend the npm script `copy:assets` with `&& npm run copy:favicons`

To copy all the assets run the npm installation script.

```
npm install
```

> **TIP**
>
> - Add the generated files to the `.gitignore` file.

#### Change font asset path

To change the path to the self provided font files we need to use SASS.
In the main SASS file of you application add the SASS variable `$font-path` to top of the page.

```scss
// change variable before the import
$font-path: '~assets/fonts';
```

> **TIP**
>
> `~` is used for webpack and angular application to create a dynamic path.

After the declaration of the `$font-path` variable, we need to import the SASS font file,
which uses this variable to create the correct path.

```scss
// Custom font faces
@import '@baloise/design-system-css/sass/font';
```

### CSS Utilities

To install the CSS Framework run the following npm command:

```
npm add @baloise/design-system-css
```

> **Important!**
>
> The CSS package is already included in the **component** packages.

#### Import

To use the CSS Utility Classes import the following stylesheet.

```scss
@import '@baloise/design-system-css/css/typography';
@import '@baloise/design-system-css/css/shadow';
```
