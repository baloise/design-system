import GridOverview from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/grid/overview.svg'

<img src={GridOverview} />

## Breakpoints

Every webpage is accessed by different screen sizes and resolutions. To create a responsive webpage we use the defined
breakpoints.

We have 6 breakpoints:

| Breakpoint          | min-width |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| **Mobile**          | 0px       |
| **Tablet**          | 769px     |
| **Desktop**         | 1024px    |
| **High-Definition** | 1280px    |
| **Widescreen**      | 1440px    |
| **FullHD**          | 1920px    |

## Containers

A container defines the max-width of a website content.

import LayoutOverview from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/layout/layout.svg'

<img src={LayoutOverview} />

| Container       | Usage                                                       | max-width |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **default**     | Default container for the most use cases.                   | 1496px    |
| **detail-page** | Special use case for the website.                           | 744px     |
| **compact**     | Should be used for sales funnels and small forms.           | 896px     |
| **blog-page**   | Special use case for the website.                           | 984px     |
| **fluid**       | For large application to use the whole width of the screen. | 100%      |

## Grid

The grid is based on 12 columns.
