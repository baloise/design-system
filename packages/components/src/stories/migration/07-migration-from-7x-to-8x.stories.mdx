# Migration from 7.x to 8.x

The following workflow walks through the steps of migrating.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

## Tabs

The property `rounded` was removed and replaced by the `interface="tabs-sub"`

```html
<!-- - old -->
<bal-tabs interface="tabs" rounded>...</bal-tabs>

<!-- + new -->
<bal-tabs interface="tabs-sub">...</bal-tabs>
...
```
