# Migration from 10.x to 11.x

The following workflow walks you through the migration steps.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

## Improved SASS styles

In the new version 11 we introduced the packages tokens and css. Those are build on SASS not SCSS and
provide a lot of CSS-Variables.

Therefore, update your `global.scss` import to just `global` or `global.sass`.
Moreover, change the import path to the alias `~` instead of using a relative path to the installed package.

```sass
<!-- - old -->
@import '../node_modules/@baloise/design-system-next-components/src/styles/global.scss';


<!-- - new -->
@import '~@baloise/design-system-next-components/src/styles/global';
```

### Vue / Vite

In order to get the `~` alias working, update the vite.config.ts file and add the resolve config
to the defineConfig function.

```typescript
  resolve: {
    alias: [
      {
        // this is required for the SCSS modules
        find: /^~(.*)$/,
        replacement: "$1",
      },
    ],
  },
```
