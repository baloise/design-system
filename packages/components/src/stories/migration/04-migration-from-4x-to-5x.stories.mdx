# Migration from 4.x to 5.x

The following workflow walks you through the migration steps from version 4.x to 5.x.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

The props of component `bal-app` have been removed, in favour of the better integration with the proxy libraries.

## App

The props `background` and `hasStickyFooter` have been removed.

```html
<!-- - old -->
<bal-app has-sticky-footer background></bal-app>

<!-- + new -->
<bal-app class="has-sticky-footer has-background"></bal-app>
...
```
